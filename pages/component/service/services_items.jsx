                    won’t be slowed down by recalibrations. Then just send us
                    your reference image, and let we’ll apply the color
                    correction to both the model and mannequin images. You’ll

                    After removing the mannequin from the image, it still looks

                    joints that are added separately make the image more
                    realistic. 3D images are more eye-catching and this effect
